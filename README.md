# AI Ops Foundations

A practical, system-first guide to adopting AI safely, responsibly, and effectively in IT Operations.

This repository is a structured digital product designed for:
- Solo IT consultants
- MSPs
- Internal IT & Platform teams
- Systems Engineers transitioning into AI-enabled operations

The focus is **not tools**, but **operating models, boundaries, and control**.

## What This Product Is

AI Ops Foundations teaches you **how to introduce AI into IT operations without creating risk, outages, or governance debt**.

You will learn:
- Where AI adds value in ops (and where it must not be trusted)
- How to design AI-aware operating models
- How to prevent automation drift and AI-induced outages
- How to document, govern, and scale AI usage responsibly

This is **vendor-agnostic** and applies regardless of:
- Cloud provider
- Ticketing platform
- Monitoring tools
- LLM vendor

---

## What This Product Is NOT

- ❌ A prompt library
- ❌ A vendor tutorial
- ❌ A fully automated AI system
- ❌ A replacement for human accountability

AI is treated as a **capability**, not a decision-maker.
