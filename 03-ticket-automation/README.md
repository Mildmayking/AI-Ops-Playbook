Module 03 — AI-Assisted Automation & Safe Delegation
Purpose of This Module

This module defines how automation is safely introduced into AI Ops without crossing into unsafe autonomy.

Automation amplifies both correctness and mistakes.
When AI is involved, that amplification becomes nonlinear.

This module establishes where automation stops and humans remain in control.

How to Consume This Module

This module consists of:

Written documentation (this README) — authoritative reference

4 short videos — applied explanation

Diagrams — automation boundary models

Rule:
AI may draft automation.
Humans approve and execute.

03.1 — Automation Is Not Autonomy

Automation executes predefined logic.
AI generates probabilistic output.

Combining the two without controls creates:

Hidden execution paths

Irreversible changes

Blurred accountability

AI may suggest automation.
AI may not autonomously trigger it.

03.2 — Approved AI Automation Use Cases
Green Zone

Drafting scripts

Suggesting runbook steps

Simulating remediation

Yellow Zone

Pre-approved, human-triggered automation

Change-managed workflows

Red Zone

Fully autonomous execution

Self-modifying automation

Privileged access changes

03.3 — Delegation Boundary Model

Every automation must define:

Who triggers it

What systems it can touch

How it can be stopped

How it is audited

(See diagram: ai-automation-boundary-flow)

03.4 — Approval Models

Safe patterns include:

Two-person approval

Environment-based gating

Time-delayed execution

Dry-run previews

Automation without friction is unsafe.

03.5 — Automation Drift

Automation drift occurs when:

AI-generated scripts are reused without review

Context changes but logic does not

Temporary fixes become permanent

Drift is inevitable.
Controls must assume it.

03.6 — What This Module Enables

After completing this module, you will be able to:

Scale automation safely

Prevent silent execution failures

Design auditable AI-assisted workflows
